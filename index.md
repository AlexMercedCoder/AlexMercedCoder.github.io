# I'm Alex Merced

## Who am I?
I've been involved in corporate training in the financial industry from 2008-2019. In high school and college I had studied many computer science concepts and C++ and dabbled in HTML/CSS ove the years. In mid-2019 I decided to finally pursue the interest I've had all along and began a very intense study of coding primarily focusing on Full Stack Development.

## Things I've worked on
I primarily have been working with **HTML5/CSS3/JSES6** along with **Python**. If you go to AlexMercedCoder.com you can find links to my _Github, Codepen and Sololearn_ pages to see many of the exercises I've been doing to learn more advanced technologies like React, Bootstrap, Materialize, Scss, Django/Mezzanine and more. 

## Things I plan on learning soon
- Node.JS/Express
- Vue JS
- C# .Net Core
- Webservers (Apache, NGINX, Gunicorn)
